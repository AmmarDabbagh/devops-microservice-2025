## üöÄ Project Overview

**DevOps Microservice 2025** is a cloud-native, containerized microservices application designed to demonstrate modern DevOps practices. The project emphasizes scalability, observability, and security, incorporating principles such as CI/CD automation, container orchestration, and DevSecOps.

## üë• Team Members

* **Ammar Dabbagh** ‚Äì Lead Developer
* **Mohammed Kadura** ‚Äì Backend Engineer
* **Ahmed Radwan** ‚Äì DevOps Engineer

## üß± Architecture

The application follows a microservices architecture, with each service encapsulating a specific business capability. Key components include:

* **API Gateway**: Routes incoming requests to appropriate services.
* **Authentication Service**: Manages user authentication and authorization.
* **User Service**: Handles user-related operations.
* **Product Service**: Manages product information.
* **Order Service**: Processes customer orders.
* **Database**: Each service has its own database to ensure loose coupling.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AmmarDabbagh/devops-microservice-2025.git
   cd devops-microservice-2025
   ```

2. **Start the application:**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

   This command builds and starts all services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

3. **Access the application:**

   * API Gateway: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
   * Grafana Dashboard: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
   * Prometheus: [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090)

*Note: Ports may vary based on your `docker-compose.yml` configuration.*

## üß™ Running Tests

Each service includes its own test suite. To run tests:

```bash
docker exec -it <service_name> npm test
```

Replace `<service_name>` with the name of the service container you wish to test.

## üîí Security

Security is integrated throughout the development lifecycle:

* **Authentication & Authorization**: Implemented using JWT and OAuth 2.0.
* **Secure Communication**: All inter-service communication is secured via HTTPS.
* **Static Code Analysis**: Automated scans using tools like ESLint.
* **Dependency Management**: Regular updates and vulnerability checks.

## üìà Monitoring & Logging

* **Prometheus**: Collects metrics from services.
* **Grafana**: Visualizes metrics and system health.
* **ELK Stack**: Centralized logging for all services.

## üìÑ API Documentation

Comprehensive API documentation is available via Swagger UI:

* [http://localhost:8080/api-docs](http://localhost:8080/api-docs)

*Note: Ensure the Swagger UI is correctly set up in your API Gateway.*
